<h2> Dynamic programming </h2> 

Dynamic programming is an optimization technique used to solve complex problems by breaking them into smaller subproblems.

Note that the dynamic programming approach is different from the divide and conquer approach. While the divide and conquer
approach breaks the problem into independent subproblems and then combines the solutions,dynamic programming breaks the
problem into dependent subproblems.

There are three important steps we need to follow when solving problems with DP:

  - Define the subproblems.
  - Implement the recurrence that solves the subproblems
  - Recognize and solve the base cases.
